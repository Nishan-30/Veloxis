## Overview

VELOXIS is a desktop application for real-time and offline traffic analysis, built specifically for the vehicle mix and road conditions found in Bangladesh. It combines a custom-trained YOLOv11 object detection model with BoTSORT multi-object tracking to deliver intersection-level traffic metrics — vehicle counts, speed distributions, queue lengths, and peak-hour factors — through a clean, research-oriented interface.

The application was developed as a final-year thesis instrument at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, SUST, focusing on non-motorized transport (NMT) behavior and intersection capacity analysis on mixed-traffic urban corridors.

## Key Features

**Detection \& Tracking**

* YOLOv11 model custom-trained on 45,862 annotated images of Bangladeshi road vehicles
* BoTSORT tracker with appearance-based Re-ID — tuned for dense, occluded intersections
* 8 native vehicle classes: car, rickshaw, CNG/auto, motorcycle, bicycle, bus, truck, easybike
* Bidirectional counting with forward/backward classification
* AI-assisted counting line placement from optical flow analysis

**Traffic Engineering Metrics**

* Peak Hour Factor (PHF) — 15-minute interval volume tracking per HCM 6th edition
* Average headway and saturation flow rate
* 85th percentile speed (V85) and mean speed
* Queue length detection (vehicles stopped behind line)
* Occupancy percentage and live vehicle density
* Near-miss and sudden braking safety event detection

**Analysis \& Export**

* Real-time HUD overlay with all metrics
* Analytics dashboard with daily, hourly, monthly, and directional charts
* Per-vehicle CSV log including all session-level metrics at time of crossing
* Session summary CSV: single-row report with PHF, V85, saturation flow, safety events
* PTV Vissim / Aimsun compatible export (volume by vehicle type per hour)
* Homography-based speed calibration for perspective-correct measurement

**Interface**

* Live camera support: webcam, USB, DroidCam (WiFi), RTSP/IP streams
* Click-to-draw counting line with visual feedback
* Video seek and frame preview before analysis
* Lane/zone drawing for approach-wise counting
* CPU performance mode for integrated-graphics laptops
* Light/dark theme

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, Windows 10/11

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nishan-30/veloxis.git
cd veloxis

# First-time setup (installs all dependencies)
setup\\\_windows.bat
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python customtkinter pillow matplotlib pandas flask
```

**Model file:** Place `bd\\\_vehicles\\\_yolo11.pt` in the project root directory. The model is not included in the repository due to file size — see [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/veloxis/releases) or train your own using the instructions below.

\---

## Quick Start

```bash
python app\\\_windows.py
```

1. Go to **File Detection** → Browse a video file
2. Click on the video frame to set the counting line (or enable AI auto-detect)
3. Click **Analyse Video**
4. Results appear in the right panel; CSV logs are saved to `data/`

For live camera:

```bash
# Navigate to Live Detection → select source → Start Detection
python app\\\_windows.py
```

\---

## Configuration

All settings are accessible through the **Settings** page in the app, or directly in `config.py`:

```python
YOLO\\\_MODEL           = "bd\\\_vehicles\\\_yolo11.pt"  # detection model
CONFIDENCE           = 0.35                      # lower for crowded roads, higher for clear daylight
FRAME\\\_SKIP           = 1                         # 1 = full accuracy, 2 = faster on CPU
CPU\\\_PERFORMANCE\\\_MODE = True                      # enable for integrated-graphics machines
PIXELS\\\_PER\\\_METER     = 55                        # calibrate for accurate speed
USE\\\_DUAL\\\_LINES       = False                     # True for bidirectional roads
```

For accurate speed estimation, use the **Calibrate Speed** page to perform a 4-point homography calibration using known road markings.

## Custom Model Training

The included model was trained on the [BD-Vehicle-Detection](https://roboflow.com) dataset. To retrain or extend it with additional vehicle classes (battery rickshaw, human hauler, leguna, nosimon, etc.):

1. Annotate images on [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) — export in YOLOv8 format
2. Open `train\\\_yolo11\\\_kaggle.py` in a Kaggle notebook with GPU T4 or T4×2
3. Fill in your Roboflow credentials and run all cells (\~3–4 hours)
4. Download `bd\\\_vehicles\\\_yolo11.pt` from the Kaggle output and place it in the project root

```python
# train\\\_yolo11\\\_kaggle.py — edit only these lines
ROBOFLOW\\\_API\\\_KEY   = "your\\\_api\\\_key"
ROBOFLOW\\\_WORKSPACE = "your\\\_workspace"
ROBOFLOW\\\_PROJECT   = "your\\\_project\\\_slug"
ROBOFLOW\\\_VERSION   = 1
MODEL\\\_SIZE         = "s"   # n / s / m / l
```

**Current model performance:**

|Metric|Value|
|-|-|
|mAP50|0.871 (YOLOv8 baseline)|
|Precision|0.882|
|Recall|0.782|
|Training images|45,862|
|Classes|8|

## Output Files

Each detection session generates files in the `data/` directory:

|File|Contents|
|-|-|
|`log\\\_YYYYMMDD\\\_HHMMSS.csv`|Per-vehicle crossing log with all metrics|
|`log\\\_YYYYMMDD\\\_HHMMSS\\\_summary.csv`|Single-row session summary (PHF, V85, saturation flow, etc.)|
|`log\\\_YYYYMMDD\\\_HHMMSS\\\_vissim.csv`|PTV Vissim / Aimsun compatible input|
|`snapshots/`|Manual snapshots from detection|
|`homography.npy`|Saved speed calibration matrix|
|`lanes.json`|Saved lane/zone polygon definitions|

## Detection Pipeline

```
Video / Camera
      ↓
Night enhancement (CLAHE, if dark frame)
      ↓
Resize to 416px (CPU mode) or 640px (GPU mode)
      ↓
YOLOv11 inference  →  coord\\\_scale back to original resolution
      ↓
BoTSORT tracking  (custom config: track\\\_buffer=45, with\\\_reid=True)
      ↓
Re-ID cache lookup  (90-frame window, prevents double-counting)
      ↓
Line crossing detection  →  direction, zone, speed
      ↓
PHF · headway · V85 · queue · occupancy
      ↓
HUD overlay  +  CSV log  +  summary
```

## Troubleshooting

|Problem|Solution|
|-|-|
|App won't start|`pip install customtkinter pillow matplotlib pandas ultralytics`|
|"Loading YOLO model..." hangs|Check `bd\\\_vehicles\\\_yolo11.pt` is in the project folder; first load takes 20–30s|
|Slow detection|Enable CPU Performance Mode in Settings, or set `FRAME\\\_SKIP=2` in `config.py`|
|No camera detected|Live Detection → Auto-scan; try camera index 0, 1, or 2|
|DroidCam not connecting|Ensure phone and laptop are on the same WiFi; test connection in the app|
|Speed values unreliable|Use Calibrate Speed page for homography calibration|
|ID switches / double counting|Already mitigated by Re-ID cache and tuned BoTSORT — if still occurring, lower `CONFIDENCE` slightly|
